# Howdy and Welcome

What is this?  

Simply put its a playground for all things [Spring Boot](http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) using the Todo as a domain model. The **"Todo"** is well understood which makes it useful for reasoning about and comparing frameworks.  For example [**TodoMvc**](http://todomvc.com) is a resource developers can use to evaluate frontend frameworks against a concise and consistent model.
